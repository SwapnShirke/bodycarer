            <h3><p class="font-italic text-center">Over the years, we’ve conducted a few attractiveness surveys. We surveyed men about women’s bodies and women about men’s bodies. In our first survey, we showed a thousand people various photo spreads, asking them to select the bodies they preferred. We asked the women if guys should improve their appearance. They said, “No.” They didn’t want to date a bodybuilder with a contrived physique. They found it more attractive when a guy was naturally fit and athletic.</p></h3>

            <p class="font-italic text-center">Before we dive deep into an ocean of details, let’s start simple, with body weight. That way, you’ll know whether you need to gain or lose weight to achieve your goal.
                One of the more important factors is simply being big and heavy enough. Crossley and colleagues found that women preferred men with a BMI of 24.5 (study). We can call this the most attractive body. Men thought guys looked best with a BMI of 25.9. We can call this the aesthetic physique.</p>

            <p class="font-italic text-center">Our drive for muscularity is innate and cultural. It’s a chicken-and-egg scenario. We love to eat both chicken and eggs because we’re naturally drawn to muscle and because society rewards us for getting stronger.Being muscular is universally attractive. The ideal amount of muscularity can vary depending on who you ask, but strength is never a weakness. We evolved in a primitive and violent world, at least by modern standards. Our muscles hint at our ability to dominate and protect others. That’s why our upper-body muscles are especially prized. They’re the muscles that swing clubs, hurl javelins, draw bow strings, and throw punches.</p>
